This is a set of configuration files I personally use on my Arch Linux install
at home. Use these configuration files at your own risk, but feel free to use
them as you wish. Also, feel free to contact the author/maintainer of this
repository, Joshua Taylor <taylor.joshua88@gmail.com>

Some configuration files are based on default configuration files or example
files provided by the application that file is configuring. I have tried to
make note of this as much as possible, but please let me know if I have
neglected to do so in one of the included configuration files.

Two scripts have been provided, UpdateLocalFromRepo.sh and
UpdateRepoFromLocal.sh

UpdateLocalFromRepo.sh is used to rsync all of the configuration files from
this repository into the user's own home directory. A dry run is performed
to warn the user about any files that would be files that would be saved to
the user's home directory. If the user provides a userExcludes file in the
same directory as this script, then the script will use all of the patterns
from that file for excluding scripts the user does not want. Please reference
repoExcludes or the rsync documentation for more information on the format
of rsync exclusion files.

UpdateRepoFromLocal.sh is the reverse operation of UpdateLocalFromRepo.sh.
This script will take configuration files from the user's own filesystem and
use rsync to update those found in the current git workspace. This script
also accepts an optional userExcludes file if it exists in the same directory.
This is a convenience script which may clobber your workspace if you are not
paying attention. I will accept pull requests, but I will not accept them if
you have clobbered your entire workspace before committing. If the config
file already exists in the repo, it is likely easiest to simply overwrite that
file in your git workspace before committing rather than running this script.
